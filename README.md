## An interactive gallery

I successful acheived this gallery by using html and css. The html file contains the structure of the gallery including images, and text overlays. I used CSS to acheive the interactivity and functionality of the gallery.

### Usage

To access the gallery, just open the `index.html` file in the web. 

# Solution to challenge one

## Overvew
This challenge is about to find if there is a contiguos subarray that sums up to the target sum. Return true if such array exists, else retun false.

## solution
To solve this challenge, I used two pointers, i and counter. One to strat counting while finding the sum and other to count starting when the sum is being greater than the target sum. Here we take the current sum minus the first value in the array. 

### Usage
You can simply access this file by opening challenge folder in this repo and then open `arrayMap.js` file.

# Solution to challenge

## Overview
This challenge is about string transformation. Return reversed string or ascii code of each character based on the conditions. If the length of the string is divisible by three then it return reversed string. If it is divisible by 5, then it return ascii code of each character of the string. Last, if it is divisible by 3 and five or 15 then return ascii codes af eacher character of reversed string.

## Solution

To solve this, it is just to apply the specified transformation based on length of the input string.

And ofcourse I acheived it by the help of loops and string methods such as reverse(), split(), and join() to reverse the string. 

Lastly, I used push method and charCodeAt to simply change the character into ascii codes.
